# Deep Learning Problems

A set of codes for computational problems I solved during the course Math 649 at Texas A&M University taught by Dr. [Siegel](https://jwsiegel2510.github.io/index.html). It includes function fitting using neural networks, image classification via convolutional neural networks, and generative modelling.
